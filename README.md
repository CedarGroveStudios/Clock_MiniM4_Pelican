# Clock_MiniM4_Pelican (Clock Minima)
## _A minimal but large clock in a Pelican 1040 Micro Case with CircuitPython_


The Clock_MiniM4 is an RTC-based minimal LED display clock implementation inspired by John Park's MetroMinimalist Clock design. The clock uses custom CircuitPython libraries __CedarGroveStudios/Unit_Converter__ for automatic Daylight Saving Time (DTS) and __CedarGroveStudios/Clock_Builder__ for display and user interface functions.

Caution: Under elevated temperature conditions, the sealed Pelican case may not sufficiently dissipate the heat from the clock electronics. A test of the internal operating temperature measured 80F (27C) when interior room temperature was nominally 77F (25C). If the clock will be operated in warmer environments, it is recommended that some holes be drilled into the case to allow air flow.
